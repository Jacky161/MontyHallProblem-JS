## What is the Monty Hall Problem?
The Monty Hall Problem is a famous mathematical probablity paradox. The scenario goes that there is a gameshow host named Monty in which there are three doors. Behind one door is a car (or some big prize). The other doors have nothing. The player picks a door and then Monty will open one of the other two doors. The door he opens **always** has nothing behind it. Then, he offers the player the chance to switch or to stay with the door they picked. 

Intuitively, most would think there is a 50% chance (1/2) that the winning prize is behind their door and a 50% chance (1/2) it is behind the other. However, the actual probability is that there is a 66.6% chance (2/3) that it is behind the other door. That would mean that you have higher odds of winning if you switch. 

This is a rather famous problem that perplexes many. The key is that Monty will always select a door that does not contain the prize. Therefore, the chance of your door having the prize is always 33.3%. The probability of prize being behind one of the other two doors is 66.6%. And since Monty will never pick one that has the prize, the probability that the other door has the prize will remain 66.6%.

## What is this project?
The Monty Hall Problem created in JavaScript. This was created by me in an attempt to really understand the Monty Hall Problem and see it through my own eyes with my own code. Coding the game itself and seeing the stats definitely helped a lot in understanding how the probabilities do end up making sense in the end, especially since I made it myself. Speaking on the code itself, I made it in 2020 which was when my coding knowledge was much more limited compared to now. It is definitely quite unoptimizied but for the purpose it served, it works fine.
